        The <a href="PointTool.htm">Point</a>, <a href="LineTool.htm">Line</a>, <a href="RectTool.htm">Rectangle</a>,
        <a href="CircleTool.htm">Circle</a>. and <a href="AngleTool.htm">Angle</a> tools use a crosshair to position
        the tool and perform measurements. The crosshair consists of four triangular sections pointing to an open center.
        All measurements are based at the center of the crosshair.
    </div>

    <div class="SubSection">Crosshair Visual States</div>
    <div class="Para">
        The crosshair can be in one of three visual states: Normal, Located and Find.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <img src="../Graphics/CrossHair.gif" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="left" width="23" height="23" border="0" title="Normal Crosshair" alt="Normal crosshair">
        <span class="LeadItem">Normal:</span> If the mouse is not positioned over the crosshair, it is in the normal state.
        The crosshair will appear red under the default color scheme.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <img src="../Graphics/CrossHairSel.gif" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="left" width="23" height="23" border="0" title="Located Crosshair" alt="Located crosshair">
        <span class="LeadItem">Located:</span> If the mouse is positioned over the crosshair, it is in the located state.
        The crosshair will appear yellow under the default color scheme. In addition to a color change, the crosshair
        will display a data window indicating the current position of the crosshair. A tooltip may also appear indicating
        which measurement point the crosshair represents.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <img src="../Graphics/CrossHairFlash.gif" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="left" width="23" height="23" border="0" title="Find Crosshair" alt="Find crosshair">
        <span class="LeadItem">Find:</span> Sometimes it can be hard to find a tool on the screen. When a new tool is selected,
        it will flash its crosshairs between the normal and selected states for a few seconds to help you locate it.
        If you lose a tool after you have selected it, you can cause it to flash again by selecting
        <span class="MenuItem">Find Crosshair</span> on the <span class="MenuItem">Tools</span> menu or
        by using the shortcut <b>Ctrl+F</b>.
    </div>

    <div class="SubSection">Reading the Crosshair Position</div>
    <div class="Para">
        The current position of a crosshair can be read in two places.
        <img src="../Graphics/AppPositionInfo.gif" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="left" width="171" height="170" border="0" title="Crosshair Position" alt="Crosshair position">
        The first is in the <a href="ToolInfoSection.htm">tool information section</a> of the Meazure program window.
        The second place is the data window associated with the crosshair.
        <img src="../Graphics/DataWin.gif" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" width="111" height="56" border="0" title="Data Window" alt="Data window">
        The data window is displayed when the mouse is placed over the crosshair. The <a href="LineTool.htm">Line</a>
        and <a href="RectTool.htm">Rectangle</a> tools
        have two crosshairs called Point 1 and Point 2 respectively. The <a href="CircleTool.htm">Circle</a> tool has
        two crosshairs called the Vertex at the center of the circle, and Point 1 on the circumference of the circle.
        The <a href="AngleTool.htm">Angle</a> tool has three crosshairs called Point 1, Point 2, and Vertex respectively.
        You can determine whether a crosshair is Point 1, 2 or the vertex either by looking at the data window or the
        tooltip associated with the crosshair.
    </div>

    <div class="SubSection">Moving the Crosshair</div>
    <div class="Para">
        Measurements are taken by moving a crosshair to the desired position on the screen. There are four ways to
        move a crosshair: mouse dragging, text field positioning, fine positioning, and hotkey positioning.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <span class="LeadItem">Mouse dragging:</span> The fastest way to position a crosshair is by dragging it using the mouse.
        Position the mouse over the crosshair so that it is in the located state. Press the left mouse button and
        drag the crosshair to the desired position. The position of the crosshair will be continuously displayed and
        the <a href="Magnifier.htm">magnifier window</a> will display the area around the crosshair as it is being
        dragged.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <span class="LeadItem">Text field positioning:</span>
        <img src="../Graphics/KeyboardPosition.gif" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" width="170" height="105" border="0" title="Keyboard Positioning" alt="Keyboard positioning">
        The crosshair can be positioned by entering a position in the text
        fields of <a href="ToolInfoSection.htm">tool information section</a> of the program. After typing in the
        position, press Enter to move the crosshair to the new position.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <span class="LeadItem">Fine positioning:</span> To move the crosshair in single pixel increments use the up/down buttons
        located next to each position text field.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <span class="LeadItem">Hotkey positioning:</span> The crosshair can be moved to the current location of the mouse pointer using <b>Ctrl+Shift+1</b>,
        <b>Ctrl+Shift+2</b> or <b>Ctrl+Shift+3</b>. The number specifies which crosshair to move in the currently selected tool. For example, if the Line tool is
        selected, pressing <b>Ctrl+Shift+2</b> moves the line's second position crosshair to the current mouse location. If the Angle tool is selected, pressing
        <b>Ctrl+Shift+3</b> moves the vertex of the angle to the current mouse location.
    </div>
    
    <div class="SubSection">Hiding the Crosshair</div>
    <div class="Para">
        The display of the crosshair can be toggled either by selecting the
        <span class="MenuItem">Hide Crosshairs</span> item on the
        <span class="MenuItem">Tools</span> menu or by pressing <b>Ctrl+B</b>.
    </div>
    
    <div class="SubSection">Changing the Crosshair Characteristics</div>
    <div class="Para">
        The colors, opacity and other characteristics of the crosshair and data window can be changed
        using the <a href="ToolPrefs.htm">Tools panel</a> on the Preferences dialog.
