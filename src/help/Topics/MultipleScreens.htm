    <div class="Para">
        The Meazure program supports systems with multiple display screens. The Windows operating system
        supports extending the desktop across multiple screens. When the desktop is extended across multiple
        screens, one screen must be designated as the primary screen. The upper left corner of the primary
        display screen contains the origin of the overall coordinate system. Windows refers to the virtual
        screen rectangle as the bounding rectangle that contains all screens. The above figure illustrates a
        system with two display screens arranged side by side. The screen on the right side is 1280 by 1024
        pixels and is designated the primary screen. The screen on the left is 1024 by 768 pixels. Notice
        that the x-axis coordinates are negative for the left display.

    <div class="SubSection">Measuring with Multiple Screens</div>
    <div class="Para">
        The Meazure program seamlessly measures across multiple screens. Depending on the relative
        orientation of the screens, the position coordinates may be negative.

    <div class="SubSection">Screen Information</div>
    <div class="Para">
        The Meazure program always displays the <a href="ScreenInfoSection.htm">size and resolution information</a>
        for the screen containing the point being measured (e.g. the screen containing a crosshair that is
        being dragged). As the measuring point is moved between screens, the screen information is updated
        to reflect the current screen.

    <div class="SubSection">Screen Resolution Calibration</div>
    <div class="Para">
        In a multiple display screen environment, each screen has its own resolution. The Meazure program
        allows the resolution of each screen to be independently <a href="Calibration.htm">calibrated</a>.
        It is important to calibrate each display screen so that measurements dependent on the screen
        resolution (e.g. inches) are accurate.
