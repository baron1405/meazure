        Meazure obtains position information from the computer operating
        system. This information is reported to Meazure in pixel units. To
        display measurements in <a href="Units.htm">units</a> other than pixels,
        Meazure must convert from pixels using the screen resolution. By default, Meazure uses the
        screen resolution reported by the operating system. However, this value is inaccurate because
        it does not reflect the physical dimensions of your display screen(s). Meazure allows you manually
        determine an accurate resolution for each display screen connected to your system. It is highly
        recommended that you calibrate Meazure the first time you use it and anytime you change a
        screen&rsquo;s pixel dimensions (e.g. going from 1024 by 768 to 1280 by 1024 pixels).

    <div class="Para">
        To access the resolution calibration panel select the
        <span class="MenuItem">Preferences</span> item on the
        <span class="MenuItem">Edit</span> menu then
        select the <span class="MenuItem">Calibration</span> tab on the Preferences
        dialog.

        The resolution calibration panel displays the calibration state for the screen
        on which it is displayed. In a multiple screen environment, the calibration panel
        must be dragged to the screen whose resolution is to be calibrated. The identification
        of the screen is displayed with the title of the calibration panel frame.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        The resolution calibration panel allows you to select whether to use the
        operating system values for the horizontal and vertical screen resolutions
        or to use a manual setting of these values. It is highly recommended that you
        select the manual setting. Before describing the calibration process, the following
        terms need to be defined:
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <span class="LeadItem">Screen Resolution</span> - The resolution is the number of pixels per inch or centimeter
        along the screen. The screen can have a different resolution in the horizontal and vertical directions
        (e.g. 90 pixels/inch by 96 pixels/inch).
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <span class="LeadItem">Screen Size</span> - The size of the screen is the number of pixels in the horizontal
        and vertical directions (e.g. 1280 by 1024 pixels).
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <span class="LeadItem">Screen Dimensions</span> - The screen dimensions are the length in inches or centimeters
        in the horizontal and vertical directions (e.g. 13 inches by 10 inches).
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        There are three methods for manually setting the screen resolution: direct resolution entry,
        direct dimension entry, or slider calibration. To use any of these methods select &quot;Set manually&quot;.
        The resolution can be calibrated using either English or Metric units. Use the inch and
        centimeter radio buttons to select the units to use for calibration. This selection affects only
        the calibration units and does not change the measurement units.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <span class="LeadItem">Direct resolution entry</span> - If you know the exact screen resolution, use this
        method to directly enter the horizontal and vertical values using the &quot;Rx&quot; and &quot;Ry&quot; text fields.
        Resolution values must be specified in pixels per inch or pixels per centimeter depending on
        the calibration units selected.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <span class="LeadItem">Direct dimension entry</span> - Using a ruler, you can measure the horizontal and
        vertical dimensions of the screen. You can then enter these dimension values using the &quot;W&quot; and &quot;H&quot;
        text fields. The dimension values must be specified in inches or centimeters depending on
        the calibration units selected.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        <span class="LeadItem">Slider measurement</span> - This method uses a ruler in conjunction
        with the horizontal and vertical sliders on the panel to set the resolution.
        Place a ruler on the screen and align it with the zero position on one of the
        sliders. If resolution calibration is being performed in inches, move the slider
        until it points to the one inch mark on the ruler. For metric calibration, move the
        slider until is points to the two centimeter mark on the ruler.
        Repeat this process for the remaining slider.

        Note that when the operating system resolution is used, a warning button appears on
        the <a href="ScreenInfoSection.htm">Screen Information section</a> of the program display.
        Pressing this button displays the resolution calibration panel.
