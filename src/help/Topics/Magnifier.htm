        The magnifier provides a view of the area around a measurement tool. In
        addition, the color of the pixel at the center of the view is shown.
        There are three parts to the magnifier: the magnifier window,
        the color display, and the zoom and freeze controls.
    </div>
    <div class="SubSection">Magnifier Window</div>
    <div class="Para">
        The magnifier window displays the area around the current <a href="ToolsOverview.htm">tool</a> (e.g.
        cursor, crosshair) magnified by the current zoom factor. When the
        <a href="CursorTool.htm">Cursor tool</a> or <a href="WindowTool.htm">Window tool</a> is selected,
        the center of the magnifier is outlined
        by a red square that corresponds to the hotspot of the cursor. When
        a tool is selected that uses a <a href="Crosshair.htm">crosshair</a>, the red outline at the center
        of the magnifier corresponds to the center of the crosshair that is being positioned.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        A grid is overlaid on the magnifier window when the zoom factor is
        4X or greater. To turn off this grid select the
        <span class="MenuItem">Magnifier Grid</span> item on the
        <span class="MenuItem">View</span> menu.
    </div>
    <div class="SubSection">Color Display</div>
    <div class="Para">
        The color of the pixel at the center of the magnifier window is shown
        below the magnifier window. The color is shown in the swatch at the right
        of the section and the color value is displayed on the left. The color
        value is reported in one of the following formats depending on the selection made on the
        <span class="MenuItem">Color Format</span> submenu on the
        <span class="MenuItem">View</span> menu.
        <br clear="left">
        <ul class="BulletList">
            <li><span class="LeadItem">RGB</span> - The color is displayed as separate red, green,
            and blue components each as a value between 0 and 255 inclusive.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">#RRGGBB</span> - The color is displayed as a single six digit
            hexadecimal number where the first two digits are the red component, the next two
            digits are the green component and the last two digits are the blue component. The
            value of each component is between 0 and 0xFF inclusive.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">CMY</span> - The color is displayed as separate cyan, magenta,
            and yellow components each as a value between 0 and 255 inclusive.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">CMYK</span> - The color is displayed as separate cyan, magenta,
            yellow, and black components.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">HSL</span> - The color is displayed as hue, saturation, and lightness
            values.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">YCbCr</span> - The color is displayed as a luminance (Y) and two
            chrominance values (Cb and Cr).</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">YIQ</span> - The color is displayed as a luminance (Y) and two
            chrominance values (Inphase, Quadrature). This format corresponds to that used in television
            broadcasting.</li>

        At the bottom of the magnifier is the zoom slider. This control sets the
        magnification factor between 1X and 32X. The zoom can also be controlled using
        the <span class="MenuItem">Zoom In</span> and <span class="MenuItem">Zoom Out</span>
        menu items on the <span class="MenuItem">View</span> menu or the <b>Ctrl++</b> and <b>Ctrl+-</b>
        keyboard combinations. At 6X and above, a grid is overlaid
        on the magnifier window. To turn off this grid select the
        <span class="MenuItem">Magnifier Grid</span> item on the
        <span class="MenuItem">View</span> menu.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        Next to the pixel color swatch is magnifier window freeze button. This button
        acts like the pause button on a VCR. Depressing the button will freeze the
        the current view in the magnifier window. Pressing the button again will
        cause the magnifier window to go live.
