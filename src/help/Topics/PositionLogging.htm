    <div class="SubSection">Overview</div>
    <div class="Para">
        Position logging is a feature of the Meazure program that allows the recording of successive
        tool positions. For example, the <a href="CursorTool.htm">Cursor tool</a> or
        <a href="PointTool.htm">Point tool</a> can be used to digitize positions along a path. The recorded
        positions can be played back, saved to a file and subsequently reloaded.
    </div>
    
    <div class="SubSection"><a name="PosRecord">Recording Positions</a></div>
    <div class="Para">
        The position of the current measurement tool is saved either by selecting the
        <span class="MenuItem">Record Position</span> item from the <span class="MenuItem">Edit</span>
        menu, by pressing <b>Ctrl+P</b>, or by using the Add button on the <a href="#PosManage">position
        management dialog</a>. A number of supporting items are recorded along with the current tool and
        its position. These items include a time stamp, the current screen size and resolution, the location
        of the coordinate system origin, and the current units. Recorded positions can be
        <a href="#PosManage">managed</a> or <a href="#PosSave">saved</a> to a file.

        Once one or more positions have been recorded they can be saved to a position log file.
        To save the recorded positions select either the <span class="MenuItem">Save Positions</span>
        or <span class="MenuItem">Save Positions As</span> item from the <span class="MenuItem">File</span> menu.
        In addition, the positions can be saved using the appropriate buttons on the
        <a href="#PosManage">position management dialog</a>. The file save dialog is the standard Windows
        save dialog with the addition of a text field for entering an optional description of the position
        log. The description, if provided, is saved in the log file.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        Positions are saved to an XML file with a <span class="Pathname">.mpl</span> file extension. The format
        of the file is described by the Position Log file DTD located at
        <a href="https://www.cthing.com/dtd/PositionLog1.dtd">https://www.cthing.com/dtd/PositionLog1.dtd</a>.
        A copy of the DTD is installed with the Meazure program in the dtd folder
        (typically <span class="Pathname">C:\Program Files\C Thing Software\Meazure\dtd</span>).
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        A position log file is loaded by selecting the <span class="MenuItem">Load Positions</span> item
        from the <span class="MenuItem">File</span> menu or by using the Load button on the
        <a href="#PosManage">position management dialog</a>. Once a position log file has been loaded, the
        <a href="#PosManage">position management dialog</a> is displayed to allow playback of the positions.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        A position log file differs from a <a href="Profiles.htm">profile file</a> in the following way.
        A profile file is designed to save a complete snapshot of the Meazure program. That is, all tool
        positions, appearance settings, calibrations, and all other preferences are saved in a profile file.
        In contrast, a position log file records the position of the current measurement tool at a point in
        time and includes only those supporting items necessary to replay the positions.

    <div class="SubSection">Deleting Positions</div>
    <div class="Para">
        Recorded positions can be deleted selectively using the <a href="#PosManage">position management</a>
        dialog, or can be completely deleted using either the management dialog or the
        <span class="MenuItem">Delete Positions</span> item on the <span class="MenuItem">Edit</span>
        menu.

        The position management dialog provides a one stop shop for recording, editing, saving, loading
        and playing back measurement tool positions. The position management dialog is modeless and can
        be accessed from the <span class="MenuItem">Manage Positions</span> item on the
        <span class="MenuItem">Edit</span> menu. In addition, the dialog is displayed whenever a position
        log file is loaded.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        At the top of the position management dialog is the position playback slider. Once positions have
        been recorded or loaded, the slider can be used to step through each position. The information
        about each position is displayed immediately below the playback slider. This information includes
        the time stamp and description associated with the position.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        At the bottom of the dialog is a set of buttons that provide complete control over managing
        measurement tool positions.
        <ul class="BulletList">
            <li><span class="LeadItem">Add</span> - <a href="#PosSave">Records</a> the current measurement

            slider with the current measurement tool position.</li>
